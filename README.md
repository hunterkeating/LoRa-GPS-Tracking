# LoRa-GPS-Tracking
This is a Python script to read GPS data from a RAK 7200 using a Raspberry Pi 4. Chirpstack was used at the web server and a RAK 2287 as the gateway. The script provides distance between 2 GPS devices (RAK 7200) and their azimuth (angle) measured clockwise from orientation of respective device. There are also files for sending messages over UDP and converting angles to a format recongnized by the Orbit spatial sound plugin.

Script created by Hunter Keating, Evan Thomas, and Jimmy Francis.
